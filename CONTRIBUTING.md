### Contributors guide.
Since this is a CS:GO command library there's no direct norm of a code style. however i would appreciate if you follow the current style, a refrence to this can be found at:

https://github.com/ElheroLeGoat/CSGO-Easy-Config/blob/main/wp/prim-reset.cfg \

in case you want to add a new gamemode, some more tweaking please split the commands into different sections, so it's easy to navigate. \

with other words: Don't be like valve, be like a good informant person.
